## Business Problem
This project focuses on key steps in the Data Analysis process: Cleaning, Transforming, Analyzing, and Visualizing data, using the Olympics Datasets from Tokyo 2020 and Beijing 2022.

The goal is to demonstrate how to work with real-world datasets by:

• Cleaning the data: removing duplicates and handling inconsistencies.

• Transforming the data: identifying and replacing specific terminologies to standardize the dataset.

• Analyzing the data: creating pivot tables to categorize by event type, discipline, and medals earned, as well as implementing slicers to group and filter results.

• Visualizing the results: generating charts to represent medal counts for better insights.

This workflow exemplifies the essential skills needed in Data Analysis, enabling more informed and insightful decisions based on data.
